NOTA BENE - I'm currently finishing up my game "Black Dog", and I'll be porting
all the changes made to arrogance to this repository when I'm finished. For now
this is a somewhat old version of the engine.

A basic C++ game engine using SDL. This is the engine I've used in the past for 
Android work, though this branch doesn't have all the Android code with it at 
the moment.

I'm currently adding 3D support: I plan to build a 3D "Risk" type strategy game
in order to test what I've added, or rather to motivate the adding, as I've
never done a 3D project before.
