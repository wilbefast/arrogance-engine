arrogance-engine
================
A basic C++ game engine using SDL. This is the engine I've used in the past for 
Android work, though this branch doesn't have all the Android code with it at 
the moment.

I'm currently adding 3D support: I plan to build a 3D "Risk" type strategy game
in order to test what I've added, or rather to motivate the adding, as I've
never done a 3D project before.
